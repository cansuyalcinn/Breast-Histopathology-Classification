# Breast-Histopathology-Classification

Breast histopathology diagnosis is the current gold standard for breast cancer detection and classification, and it is exclusively performed by pathologists.
Applications of image analysis and artificial intelligence can be highly beneficial for reducing the workload of the classification process.
The goal of this project is to develop CADx systems for the classification of breast histopathological images intro binary clinical endpoints.

The pipeline of the project is shown below:
